        <p>I never thought I was going to go into computer science. When I was little I wanted to be an astronaut, but I didn't think I was smart enough. Then I wanted to be a teacher, then an artist, then an interior designer, then a psychologist. In highschool. I got introduced to the field ofbusiness. I studied business in highschool for three years, competed in business competitions, and selected nearly all of my electives based on what would be best for a business student. I only took one computer science class because my business teacher recommended it. I ended up liking it a lot, but not enough to change my plans. I went into college as a business major, and due to my AP classes I was able to draw up a plan to gradute in four  years with a triple major in business. However, near the end of my first semester, I found out that I could apply to be an astronaut if I had a masters degree in computer science. I felt like I had to at least try, so I switched my major to Computer Science even though it completely threw off my four year plan. I really enjoyed my one semester of computer science in college before the pandemic started. The pandemic threw off a lot of my plans, and now I'm here!</p>
