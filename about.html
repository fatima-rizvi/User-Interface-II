        <h3>I like to use my hands</h3>
        <p>I'll at least try to make almost anything! Although currently I'm the most comfortable wih lettering and pyrography, I have also tried glass etching, sewing, embroidery, jewelry making and woodworking. I'd like to try wood carving and resin art eventually.</p>
        <h3>I love to read</h3>
        <p>My favorite generes are adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy! But I also enjoy books on psychology and the occasional history book.</p>
        <h3>I studied business in highschool and college</h3>
        <p>In highschool, I took marketing, advertising, and accounting classes. I also competed in DECA in the Business Services Marketing cluster. In college I took an Intro to Business course and a class called Computer in Business. Even though I'm no longer studying business, it's a almost kinda silly how much informatin is still stuck in my head! I'll be watching a commercial or see a new product release and all I can think about is all of the steps it took to take that from planning to execution.</p>
        <h3>I love event planning</h3>
        <p>In highschool, my friend and I started planning so many large scale events for our friends that we made it into an unofficial company called Fwoosh. If you're curious, there's more about it on my Linkden. While it was never an officially registered company, we would spend so much time and effort making plans and then executing said plans that we thought it deserved some recognition. AT the very least, it brings up a great talking point in job interviews that can showcase planning, management, and organization skills!</p>
